<h2> Day 1 of Art 299 </h2>
  <div class= "journal">
<h3> Today I stepped foot in the John Mitchell Center for the first time (as a junior). It's kind of a fun classroom and I like the chairs a lot. I'm glad this is a small class, it makes me feel a lot more comfortable. The content of this class also seems really cool so I'm excited for that. :)

    <h2> Day 2 of Art 299 </h2>
    <div class= "journal">
      <h3> The weather today is definetly not ideal. Luckily I live on campus so I don't have to drive. Making a website is a little confusing but pretty fun. Pixel art is fun! I had been meaning to try it.
